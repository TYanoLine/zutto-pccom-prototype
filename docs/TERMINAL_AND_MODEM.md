# Terminal, modem, telephone, and transport

## Client target

Initial client is a fictional 1996 PC-98 communications application. It may evoke period software but must not be a pixel-for-pixel copy of a particular commercial/shareware application unless explicitly intended and legally appropriate.

Baseline display target:

- 640×400
- 80×25 text cells
- PC-98/Japanese bitmap-font feel
- 16-color-era presentation
- full-width / half-width handling
- box drawing
- cursor blink and terminal beep
- host-dependent ANSI/ESC usage

Long-term terminal implementation should favor a controlled Canvas 2D cell buffer over DOM-heavy rendering so byte-oriented terminal behavior remains deterministic.

Canonical stored text is UTF-8. The future terminal/serial wire boundary should use CP932/Shift_JIS-compatible bytes where historically appropriate.

## Modem interaction

Hayes-style interaction is first-class UX:

- `AT`
- `OK`
- `ATDT...`
- `A/`
- `ATH`
- `BUSY`
- `NO CARRIER`
- `NO DIALTONE` / no-answer variants where appropriate
- `CONNECT 2400/9600/14400/28800` and later historically supported rates

Handshake audio should be based on modem protocol behavior rather than arbitrary retro beeps. Existing synthesis research lives in `docs/MODEM_HANDSHAKE_SYNTHESIS.md`.

## Transport is not the call

A WebSocket is a transport attachment, not the logical BBS/call session.

A logical call session survives a brief browser/network interruption. The server retains the session and line occupancy during a reconnect grace period. A replacement WebSocket may resume that session. Explicit `ATH`, host logout, or grace expiry terminates it.

Do not regress this by tying BBS runtime lifetime directly to one WebSocket object's lifetime.

## Telephone network

Long-term BUSY behavior should reflect logical line occupancy, NPC schedules, popularity, line count, time/day, events, and host policy.

The service may maintain an atmospheric pseudo telephone bill. It never charges real telephone money. Telehodai-style simulation uses registered destination numbers and a 23:00–08:00 window; exact historical tariffs must be researched before being presented as accurate.

## Real hardware target

The same logical host/session layer should eventually support a real PC-98 over RS-232C through a bridge that emulates sufficient Hayes modem behavior. WebSocket and Serial are transports into the same BBS/world model, not separate worlds.
